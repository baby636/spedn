=================================

Spedn is a high level smart contracts language for Bitcoin Cash.
It is designed for explicitess and safety:

* It is statically typed - detects many errors at compile time
* It is explicitly typed - no guessing what the expression is supposed to return
* It is purely-functional - free of side effects, the common source of bugs
* It has a familiar C-like syntax

This package contains a [BCH-JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@psf/bch-js) runtime for Bitcoin Cash applications using compiled Spedn contracts.

If you want to dynamically compile Spedn contracts in your app, also install [@spedn/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spedn/sdk).

If you want to use Spedn compiler as a command-line tool, install [@spedn/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spedn/cli).

Spedn is a high level smart contracts language for Bitcoin Cash.
It is designed for explicity and safety:

* It is statically typed - detects many errors at compile time
* It is explicitly typed - no guessing what the expression is supposed to return
* It is purely-functional - free of side effects, the common source of bugs
* It has a familiar C-like syntax

This package contains an SDK for compiling Spedn contract in NodeJS apps.

If you want to just use an already compiled contract, use one of the runtimes instead:

* [@spedn/rts-bchjs](https://npmjs.com/packages/@spedn/bchjs-rts) - for apps on top of [BCH-JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@psf/bch-js)
* [@spedn/rts-bitbox](https://npmjs.com/packages/@spedn/bchjs-rts) - for apps on top of [BITBOX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitbox-sdk)

If you want to use Spedn as a command-line tool, use this package instead: [spedn-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spedn-cli).

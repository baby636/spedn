Spedn is a high level smart contracts language for Bitcoin Cash.
It is designed for explicity and safety:

* It is statically typed - detects many errors at compile time
* It is explicitly typed - no guessing what the expression is supposed to return
* It is purely-functional - free of side effects, the common source of bugs
* It has a familiar C-like syntax

This package contains a command-line tool for compiling contracts. For usage instructions, type:

`spedn --help`

If you want to use Spedn as a NodeJS library, use this package instead: [spedn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spedn).
